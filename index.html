	I received my B.S. in psychology at the University of Washington in Seattle, WA. I worked with Professor <a href="http://faculty.washington.edu/agg/">Anthony Greenwald</a> for two years as his Honors advisee. I am currently a research assistant at the <a href="http://ssnl.stanford.edu/">Stanford Social Neuroscience Lab</a> supervised by Professor Jamil Zaki.
